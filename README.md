# Gravity-Simulator

Program which simulates the movement of point particles of equal mass under their mutual gravitational attraction.

SDL was used for the graphics.

The entity component framework was written from scratch in C++.

Left click to place point particle in the window.
Any particle which moves out of bounds is automatically destroyed by the Manager.

## Note: 

  The force of gravity is scaled up to make the motion of the particles obvious however the inverse square law is still maintained.
